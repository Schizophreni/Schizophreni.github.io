<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

👋 Hello, this is Wu Ran. I am currently a postdoc. in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, supervised by [prof. Chao Ma](https://vision.sjtu.edu.cn). Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. of computer science in Fudan University, supervised by [Prof. Hong Lu](https://faculty.fudan.edu.cn/mvl/zh_CN/index.htm).

🖼️ I am currently focusing on image restoration, 3D scene generation, and weather-related vision recognition. I am also interested in computer graphics techniqes. In the future, I will build my career primarily on weather-related open-world vision problems.

🌴 During my doctoral period, I have maintained a repository [DerainResearch](https://github.com/Schizophreni/DerainResearch), an extension to [DerainZoo](https://github.com/nnUyi/DerainZoo), to collect latest image restoration and image deraining papers. I will keep on maintaining this repo.
